Summary:
Create a Blender curve from a 3D parametric function.
This allows for a 3D plot to be made of the function, which can be converted into a mesh.

I have documented the inner workings here, but if you're not interested and just want to
suit this to your own function, scroll down to the bottom and edit the `f(t)` function and
the iteration count to your liking.

This code has been checked to work on Blender 2.92.

    """
    Creates a Blender bezier curve object from a parametric function.
    This "plots" the function in 3D space from `min <= t <= max`.

    :param function:
        The function to plot as a Blender curve.

        This function should take in a float value of `t` and return a 3-item tuple or list
        of the X, Y and Z coordinates at that point:
        `function(t) -> (x, y, z)`

        `t` is plotted according to `min <= t <= max`, but if `use_cubic` is enabled, this function
        needs to be able to take values less than `min` and greater than `max`.
    :param *args:
        Additional positional arguments to be passed to the plotting function.
        These are not required.
    :param use_cubic:
        Whether or not to calculate the cubic bezier handles as to create smoother splines.
        Turning this off reduces calculation time and memory usage, but produces more jagged
        splines with sharp edges.
    :param iterations:
        The 'subdivisions' of the parametric to plot.
        Setting this higher produces more accurate curves but increases calculation time and
        memory usage.
    :param resolution_u:
        The preview surface resolution in the U direction of the bezier curve.
        Setting this to a higher value produces smoother curves in rendering, and increases the
        number of vertices the curve will get if converted into a mesh (e.g. for edge looping)
    :param **kwargs:
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the plotting function.
        These are not required.
