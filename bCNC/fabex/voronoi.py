For programmatic use two functions are available:

computeVoronoiDiagram(points, xBuff, yBuff, polygonsOutput=False, formatOutput=False) :
Takes :
	- a list of point objects (which must have x and y fields).
	- x and y buffer values which are the expansion percentages of the bounding box rectangle including all input points.
	Returns :
	- With default options :
	  A list of 2-tuples, representing the two points of each Voronoi diagram edge.
	  Each point contains 2-tuples which are the x,y coordinates of point.
	  if formatOutput is True, returns :
			- a list of 2-tuples, which are the x,y coordinates of the Voronoi diagram vertices.
			- and a list of 2-tuples (v1, v2) representing edges of the Voronoi diagram.
			  v1 and v2 are the indices of the vertices at the end of the edge.
	- If polygonsOutput option is True, returns :
	  A dictionary of polygons, keys are the indices of the input points,
	  values contains n-tuples representing the n points of each Voronoi diagram polygon.
	  Each point contains 2-tuples which are the x,y coordinates of point.
	  if formatOutput is True, returns :
			- A list of 2-tuples, which are the x,y coordinates of the Voronoi diagram vertices.
			- and a dictionary of input points indices. Values contains n-tuples representing the n points of each Voronoi diagram polygon.
			  Each tuple contains the vertex indices of the polygon vertices.

computeDelaunayTriangulation(points):
	Takes a list of point objects (which must have x and y fields).
	Returns a list of 3-tuples: the indices of the points that form a Delaunay triangle.
